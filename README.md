# sqlalchemy-challenge
Module 10 challenge - 20240229 - Ryan MacFarlane

All code was written and executed using Visual Studio Code.  

No tutor or classmate collaboration this week, so all code was written by myself.  I did receive guidance and help from the Xpert Learning Assistant on the BCS website.

Another specific note - I moved the 'hawaii.sqlite' file from the Resources folder, into the main SurfsUp folder - but only for the SQLAlchemy python script portion of the exercise.  For some reason I just couldn't get it to run properly without doing this.  So you will see my 'app.py' file reference the sqlite file in that location.  I assume the graders will have access to that file and will handle connecting both portions of the exercise to it - but I wanted to make sure I pointed this little anomaly out for the sake of completeness.

If you have any trouble accessing, or have any questions - please reach out to me at atlis34@yahoo.com.

Thank you for reading/grading!
Ryan MacFarlane
